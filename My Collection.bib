abstract = {Business process models are increasingly used for capturing business operations of companies. Such models play an important role in the requirements elicitation phase of to-be-created information systems and in as-is analysis of business efficiency. Many process modeling initiatives have grown considerably big in size involving dozens of modelers with varying expertise creating and maintaining hundreds, sometimes thousands of models. One of the roadblocks towards a more effective usage of these process models is the often insufficient provision of quality assurance. The aim of this paper is to give an overview on how empirical research informs structural and textual quality assurance of process models. We present selected findings and show how they can be utilized as a foundation for novel automatic analysis techniques. {\textcopyright}International Federation for Information Processing 2013.},
